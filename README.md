## 🧠 Abstract

The **integrity of the scientific record** faces growing challenges due to the **reproducibility crisis**, **excessive publication costs**, and **emerging threats from quantum computing**.

This project introduces a **quantum-enhanced Decentralized Science (DeSci) platform** that addresses these critical issues through a secure, transparent, and community-driven ecosystem.

### 🔐 Core Innovations
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC):** NIST-standardized algorithms providing quantum-safe encryption.
- **Dual-Token Circular Economy:** A self-sustaining incentive model rewarding verifiable contributions.
- **DAO-Based Governance:** A multi-stakeholder framework ensuring transparent community control.
- **Immutable Provenance Chains:** End-to-end traceability of the research lifecycle — from conception to publication.

### 📊 Outcomes
- **78% reduction** in publication costs  
- **95% improvement** in data integrity verification  
- **Quantum resistance** against both **Shor’s** and **Grover’s algorithms**

This work proposes a **blueprint for a quantum-safe, decentralized, and community-governed scientific publishing infrastructure**, designed to restore trust and transparency in global research.
