## Abstract

[span_0](start_span)The integrity of the scientific record is undermined by a persistent reproducibility crisis, prohibitive publication costs, and an emergent vulnerability to quantum computing threats[span_0](end_span). [span_1](start_span)This paper presents the comprehensive architecture of a novel quantum-enhanced Decentralized Science (DeSci) platform engineered to address these multifaceted limitations[span_1](end_span). [span_2](start_span)The proposed system integrates a formidable suite of advanced technologies, including NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms...[span_2](end_span) [span_3](start_span)a self-sustaining, dual-token circular economy; a multi-stakeholder Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for community-led governance[span_3](end_span)[span_4](start_span); and immutable provenance chains that meticulously track the entire research lifecycle[span_4](end_span). [span_5](start_span)Through this architecture, the platform achieves a projected 78% reduction in publication costs, a 95% improvement in data integrity verification, and robust quantum resistance against threats posed by both Shor's and Grover's algorithms[span_5](end_span). [span_6](start_span)...This work contributes a novel architectural blueprint for a quantum-safe, community-governed scientific publishing infrastructure designed to resolve the reproducibility crisis through verifiable provenance...[span_6](end_span).
